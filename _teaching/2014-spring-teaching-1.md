The intent of this course of this course is to present a comprehensive look into the practical appeal of linear and integer programming. Each unit will focus on a particular class of optimization problems, and include a data-driven case study revolving around a real-world application. The topics of these case studies run the gamut from fantasy football line-up selection to Amazon delivery truck routing to picking the perfect McDonald's order.
